### Notes

1. **Recovery is prioritized** – Ensure proper rest, hydration, and nutrition to support muscle growth and fat loss.

2. **Form and control are emphasized** – Injury risk increases slightly with age, so focusing on controlled movements is key.

3. **Progressive overload is managed smartly** – Adjust reps, sets, and intensity based on how your body responds rather than pushing too hard.

4. **Joint health is monitored** – If exercises like pistol squats or plyometric push-ups feel too intense, modify them with assisted versions.
