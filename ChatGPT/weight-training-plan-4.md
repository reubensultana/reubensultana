# Weight Training Plan 4 (2026)

The below workouts were actually not created by ChatgPT, but rather by myself based on my own preferences, and listening to my body. They have been included here for your reference.

## Six Day Rotation Workout Plan

Do this six-day weight training plan on a rotating basis, ensuring you target all major muscle groups while incorporating exercises to counteract the effects of a sedentary job. Each session should take around 60 minutes to complete.  

Warmup: 5-10 minutes of light cardio (treadmill walking, cycling, rowing) and dynamic stretches.  
Stretching: 5-10 minutes of full-body stretching focusing on major muscle groups.

## Single Bar Workout

The idea of this workout is to use a single 20kg bar (add iterations and/or plates as you progress) to perform a full-body routine that targets all major muscle groups. This workout should be done no more than once a week, with at least one rest day before going back to your regular workout plan.

- Warmup: 5-10 minutes of light cardio (treadmill walking, cycling, rowing) and dynamic stretches.  
- Stretching: 5-10 minutes of full-body stretching focusing on major muscle groups.

Grab the 20kg bar and perform the following exercises in a circuit format without letting go of the bar.
Complete 10 reps of each exercise for 3-4 rounds, resting for 1-2 minutes between rounds.

1. Biceps Curls
2. Shoulder Press
3. Tricep Extensions
4. Back Squats
5. Upright Row
6. Single Leg Lunges
7. Landmine Twists
8. Upright Press and Clean
9. Front Squats
10. Calf Raises

- Cooldown: 5-10 minutes of light cardio and static stretching.
